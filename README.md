# Reused-Code-R
 Libraries and functions in R, often reused

Be sure to update `reusedCodeDir` in `Read-Data-and-Library.R` when placing in another directory.


To use all functions and files, assuming you placed this folder within another working directory:
```r
# Source file to read library and functions
source('Reused-Code-R/Read-Data-and-Library.R')
```
